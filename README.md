# *wll-interface*

Wolfram [*LibraryLink*](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/LibraryLink/tutorial/Overview.html) is a tool provided by [Wolfram Language](http://www.wolfram.com/language/) (*Mathematica*) to connect to external dynamic libraries. 

*wll-interface* is a header only library written in C++, which makes *LibraryLink* much easier to use.
